  			<h3>What is the Demonetized Web?</h3>
  			<p>Well, it's not really anything yet... But here's the plan:</p>
			<p>The internet's highest value is its ability to curate and filter community knowledge, 
			but it has become so bloated, filled with scripts, trackers, and ads that it is absolutely 
			miserable to use.  Our mission is to clean it up.</p>

	<h3 style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/">Here is a demonstration of the problem.</a></h3>
	
	<p>Our core philosophy is that highest value of a community will arise when
	 members produce content purely to share, rather than to profit. Hence the <i>demonetized</i>.
	Our ultimate goal is to implement a search engine and/or registry of high quality, bloat and ad-free sites
	that are driven by every creator's passion instead of the despicable financial interest that we have allowed 
	to run the internet today. </p>
	
	<p><strong>We will create a better hub of community knowledge for everybody.</strong></p>
